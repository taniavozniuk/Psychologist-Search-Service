# MindBloom 

is a modern web application that allows you to quickly and conveniently find a psychologist based on selected criteria, book and pay for an appointment.
The user can use filters to select a specialist who best meets his needs. After selecting filters, the user sees several suggested psychologists who fit the criteria. After selecting a psychologist, a page opens with detailed information about the specialist, reviews from other users, and the opportunity to book a consultation.

## Design
The website design focuses on calmness, trust, and easy information perception.Designer chose a soft color palette, clean typography, and a simple grid structure to help users concentrate on the main goal ‚Äî choosing a psychologist. The interface is built on principles of visual hierarchy: key actions are highlighted, and information is presented gradually and without overload. The layouts were created in Figma, where designer assembled a UI Kit of reusable components to maintain visual consistency and facilitate development.
